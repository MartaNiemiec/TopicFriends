### Checklist before committing / pull-request:
- [ ] read this checklist and checkmark the items
- [ ] think of the reviewers and make their life easier :) while also keeping You reputation good by committing high-quality code and avoiding bad-quality commits
- [ ] self-review before committing, with graphical diff (e.g. IDE), ideally with per-character diff highlight.
- [ ] provide descriptive commit message, pull-request titles and branch names, including issue number in commit message, e.g. #123
- [ ] use spell-checker built into Your IDE
- [ ] please avoid compiler warnings or tslint / codelyzer / IDE warnings
- [ ] run unit tests `npm test` and TestCafe `cd e2e-testcafe && npm i && npm test`
- [ ] small files / modules / classes / methods / components (single responsibility principle). Even if a given thing seems like it will not be re-used, it should be split off, for the sake of making it easier to analyse it (and maybe it will actually be reused in the future or a new implementation will be developed / experimented-on in the future)
- [ ] please don't put random changes in pull-requests, e.g. reformatting entire files, changing quotes to double/single, etc. For the sake of easier reviewing and not polluting `git annotate`
- [ ] please follow platform / language / library style guide
  - camelCaseVariableNames
  - CamelCaseClassNames  
- [ ] avoid duplicate code. Do not copy-paste ~2 or more lines. Instead extract component / class / method and reuse in all places. For the sake of future maintenance.
