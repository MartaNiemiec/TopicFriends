    Log in via LinkedIn
    <!-- LinkedIn log-in disabled until further discussion.
      Considerations:
      - implemented using firebase sdk (not AngularFire) which might collide (version/instance)
      - requires paid firebase plan (blaze) - hosting costs started to sum up
      - not much value (LinkedIn does not seem to have a lot of APIs to get data?)
      - JSONP - being phased out?
      - pending questions over which parts should or should not go into which html files
